# Dense Captioning Events in Video - Evaluation Code

For python3

adapted from https://github.com/ranjaykrishna/densevid_eval.git
and https://github.com/v-iashin/MDVC.git

## Usage
First, clone this repository and make sure that all the submodules are also cloned properly.
```
git clone https://github.com/wjn922/densevid_val_py3.git
```

Next, download the dataset using
```
./download.sh
```

Finally, test that the evaluator runs by testing it on our ```sample_submission.json``` file by calling:
```
python evaluate.py
```

You are now all set to produce your own dense captioning results for videos and use this code to evaluate your mode:
```
python evaluate.py -s YOUR_SUBMISSION_FILE.JSON
```
